Classroom instructors can now quickly and effectively create optimal groupings informed by Dr. Spencer Kagan's research.  Add students to your roster and make data informed groupings with the click of a button.

## Developers

Fork this repo and clone the contents if you want to modify or add to the project.  My long-term vision is that this application will be a swiss-army knife of classroom widgets that help make the lives of teachers easier.

Once forked, make sure to run bundle install to ensure the gems are up to date on your machine.  Also run rake db:migrate to migrate the database on your end.
