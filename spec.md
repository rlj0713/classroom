# Specifications for the Sinatra Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Use Sinatra to build the app
    My application controller inherits from 'Sinatra' which means that I can call methods like 'get "/" do'.  These methods are generated by Sinatra and allow me to direct traffic on my web application.  Sinatra is mounted on rack, which allows me to run rack-up or more practically shotgun to serve my application. 
- [x] Use ActiveRecord for storing information in a database
    My application database is sqlite3 but without ActiveRecord, it would be tedious to write queries.  Active record generates a set of methods and make a tidy link between the database, the class, and the controller.  I use Active Record methods in my controllers to instantiate new instance objects and to make queries of the database itself.  I'm sure there is more functionality that I have not unpacked yet.
- [x] Include more than one model class (e.g. User, Post, Category)
    I have only two classes.  I wanted to keep things simple until I fully understood the concepts at hand.  My two classes are 'users' and 'students.'
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship on your User model (e.g. User has_many Posts)
    In this web application, a user has many students.
- [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship on another model (e.g. Post belongs_to User)
    In this web application, a student belongs to a user.
- [x] Include user accounts with unique login attribute (username or email)
    This was one of the more challenging requirements.  At face value, creating a unique log-in was simple.  The tricky part was keeping things separate and avoiding security holes.
- [ ] Ensure that the belongs_to resource has routes for Creating, Reading, Updating and Destroying
- [ ] Ensure that users can't modify content created by other users
    See comment above.
- [ ] Include user input validations
- [x] BONUS - not required - Display validation failures to user with error message (example form URL e.g. /posts/new)
    When users log-in with incorrect passwords or try to sign-up with someone else's username, there is an error screen.
- [ ] Your README.md includes a short description, install instructions, a contributors guide and a link to the license for your code.
    I wrote this out, but unlike the previous project there is not as much that users need to do to clone this repo.
